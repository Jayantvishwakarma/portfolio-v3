# FullStack-Web-Portfolio
I coded this website to look back on in the future and see how far i've gone.
# My Goal
I used this website as something I can look back on in 2+ years and see my success and how far I have came. This website will be used as a resume, i'll update it when I need to. Another goal is that I get recognized for Full Stack web dev jobs. Wish me luck!
